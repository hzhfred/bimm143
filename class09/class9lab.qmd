# 1: Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

```{r}
PDBSummary <- "PDBSummary.csv"
PDBSummary <- read.csv("PDBSummary.csv", row.names=1)
PDBSummary
```

Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy ?

X-ray:

    86.28665

EM:

    6.522546

X-ray + EM:

    92.80919

```{r}
#total
tot <- sum(as.numeric(sub(',','',PDBSummary$Total)))
# X-ray
XR = 100*sum(as.numeric(sub(',','',PDBSummary$X.ray)))/tot
XR
# EM:
EM = 100*sum(as.numeric(sub(',','',PDBSummary$EM)))/tot
EM
# X-ray + EM 
XR + EM
```

Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

    0.9784631

```{r}
Prot = (as.numeric(sub(',','',PDBSummary["Protein (only)",]$Total)) + as.numeric(sub(',','',PDBSummary["Protein/Oligosaccharide",]$Total)) + as.numeric(sub(',','',PDBSummary["Protein/NA",]$Total)))/tot
Prot
  
```

Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

Query "HIV" matches 4707 structures

# 2. Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

## Using Mol\*

Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

hydrogen are too small, so we only see oxygen

Q5: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have ?

H2O 308

Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain (we recommend "Ball & Stick" for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

# 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

load data

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
```

```{r}
pdb
```

Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 198

Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? MK1

Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 2

Atom records of a PDB file:

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

# 4. Comparative structure analysis of Adenylate Kinase

Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? msa

Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?: bio3d-view

Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? True

## Search and retrieve ADK structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
```

```{r}
aa
```

Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence? 214

```{r}
# Blast or hmmer search 
#b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
# Plot a summary of search results
#hits <- plot(b)
```

```{r}
# List out some 'top hits'
#(hits$pdb.id)
```

Use these for analysis:

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

Download files

```{r}
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)

```

## Align and superpose structures

```{r}
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE)#, exefile="msa")
```

```{r}
# Vector containing PDB codes for figure axis
ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)

# Draw schematic alignment
plot(pdbs, labels=ids)
```

## Principal component analysis

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
# Calculate RMSD
rd <- rmsd(pdbs)

# Structure-based clustering
hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)

plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col="grey50", bg=grps.rd, pch=21, cex=1)
```

# 5. Optional further visualization

```{r}
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")

```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)

df <- data.frame(PC1=pc.xray$z[,1], 
                 PC2=pc.xray$z[,2], 
                 col=as.factor(grps.rd),
                 ids=ids)

p <- ggplot(df) + 
  aes(PC1, PC2, col=col, label=ids) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 20) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
p
```

# 6. Normal mode analysis \[optional\]

```{r}
modes <- nma(pdbs)
plot(modes, pdbs, col=grps.rd)


```

Q14. What do you note about this plot? Are the black and colored lines similar or different? Where do you think they differ most and why?

black and colored look similar in shape but the colored lines have bigger magnitude. \
